            <h2>RangeMarkerDemo1</h2>
            A demo showing range markers on a scatter plot.  Here we've added 
            one marker to each axis, but each axis supports multiple markers
            if required.  The demo also makes use of a custom color source to
            allow highlighting of the data values that fall within the 
            intersection of the marked ranges.
